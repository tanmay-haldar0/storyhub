## About the website

This is my final project for [Harvard CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/) course. It's a website named *“StoryHub”* that was created in order to give everyone a chance to let the world know about how amazing a story could be. Every user can add a story about anything.


StoryHub allows users to create and share stories without the need to reveal their identity. Simply create an account, write your story, and hit "Post" to share it with the community. You can also browse and read stories from other users, and even leave comments if you'd like.

To keep the community safe and welcoming, we have a few rules in place:

- No personal attacks or bullying
- No spam or self-promotion
- No illegal or inappropriate content
We hope you enjoy using StoryHub and look forward to reading your stories!

This website is built using Flask, a web framework for Python, and features a clean and modern design with HTML and CSS.



## Description

Web application is based on Flask framework. I used [cs50 python lib](https://github.com/cs50/python-cs50) for working with database, it can be freely downloaded from github or replaced with something like SQLite.

## How to use

To run the web application use these commands:

```
$ export FLASK_APP=application.py
$ flask run
```

## Requirements

- python 3
- flask
- cs50
- werkzeug
